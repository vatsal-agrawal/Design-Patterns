Decorator pattern is used to add additional responsibility/ functionality to existing behaviour of an object without altering its original structure.

This pattern creates a decorator class which is wrapper to the existing class and provides additional functionality keeping class methods signature intact.

The decorator pattern uses composition providing a flexible alternative to subclassing.
Subclassing adds behaviour at compile time, and the change affects all instances of the original class,
however decorator provides additional behaviour at runtime for individual objects
