Identify the parts of your program that vary and separate them from what stays the same.

It is actually very straightforward — the principle states to separate and “encapsulate” anything that
changes frequently so that all the code that changes lives in one place.
That way the code that changes will not have any effect on the rest of the program and our application
is more flexible and robust.
