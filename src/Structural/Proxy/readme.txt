The Proxy design pattern is part of the Structural Design Pattern Family, it let us create a placeholder
 or substitute for a real object. A real-life example will be, Imagine you have run a big delivery businessðŸ›’,
you got to deliver the package to a consumer now the question arises what should use you used delivery
the particular carðŸš— , truck ðŸšš or bicycleðŸ›µ. So to solution could be we give input as the size of a package
based on that we decide which would be the best possible mode of transportation but if the package info
doesnâ€™t match with the condition we through default message for it.
Thatâ€™s how the Proxy pattern works in real life.

Definition:
The Proxy pattern is a design pattern that lets us provide a substitute or placeholder for another object.
A proxy controls access to the original object, allowing you to perform something either before or after
the request gets through to the original object.
